          <p class="timeline-body">The second single from LU●MINA6, “Zero Motion”, is proving the group is more than just concept and vocals — they’ve got moves. The sharp, fast-paced electronic track features a choreo moment dubbed “the gravity glitch,” which has sparked over 250K TikTok recreations. Leo, one of the group's main dancers, says the move was inspired by “breaking out of silence and into rebellion.” The single has charted in 8 countries and hit #1 on Spotify’s “New K-Pop Radar” playlist.</p>
